# kivis

kivis is a tool for taking notes.

It's meant to keep your mind focussed on the coding task at hand by allowing you to offload any distracting thoughts straight from the command line. This way you don't need to lift your hands from the keyboard to write something down with a pen, nor do you need to open a browser which could hijack your attention.

The name means 'in stone' in Estonian.

## Usage

```bash
kivis add call Santa about Christmas gifts
kivis show
```
